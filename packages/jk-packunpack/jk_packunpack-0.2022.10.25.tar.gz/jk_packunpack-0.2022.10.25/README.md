jk_packunpack
==========

Introduction
------------

Helper module to create or unpack tar archives, compress or uncompress files.

Information about this module can be found here:

* [github.org](https://github.com/jkpubsrc/python-module-jk-packunpack)
* [pypi.python.org](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/jk_packunpack)

Why this module?
----------------

For a wide variety of applications it would be very convenient to have a simple API for packing/unpacking tar files
and for compressing/uncompressing files with standard algorithms. This is the reason why this module has been
created: To simplify such tasks.

Important note
--------------------------

**ATTENTION:** The API of this module has been changed with the release `0.2022.2.6`.

The reasons for this quite uncommon modification:
* The author was able to improve the API and it does not make much sense to continue with an API of lower quality.
* To the knowledge of the author this module does not have many users anyway.
* An upgrade to the new API is simple.

Upgrading is very simple. For this you have two possibilities:
* If you want to continue using the old API please refer to classes `Packer1` and `Unpacker1` instead of  `Packer` and `Unpacker`.
* If you want to use the more advanced API modify your calls to methods in `Packer` and `Unpacker`. This is a simple step as the new implementations are very similar, you just need to invoke them with named arguments.

Limitations of this module
--------------------------

This module supports the following compression algorithms only:
* `gzip`
* `bzip2`
* `xz`
This compression/uncompression is performed using the standard implementations provided by Python.

Packing and unpacking of `tar` files is supported as well, but only on POSIX operating systems. The reason for this is that
internally the `tar` program is invoked directly, which is not available on non-POSIX operating systems.

How to use this module
----------------------

### Import this module

Please include this module into your application using the following code:

```python
import jk_packunpack
```

For logging import the `jk_logging` module:

```python
import jk_logging
```

### Compress a file

The following example demonstrates how to compress a file with `gzip`:

```python
inputFilePath = "myinputfile.txt"
compression = "gzip"
chmodValue = 0o700

with jk_logging.ConsoleLogger.create() as log:

	resultInfo = jk_packunpack.Packer.compressFile(
		filePath=inputFilePath,
		compression=compression,
		chModValue=chmodValue,
		log=log)

	print(resultInfo.toFilePath)
```

For `chmodValue` you can specify a string such as "`rw-rw----`" or an instance of `jk_utils.ChModValue` as well.

For compression you can specify any of these values: `gz`, `gzip`, `bz2`, `bzip2`, `xz`.

### Uncompress a file

The following example demonstrates how to uncompress a file:

```python
inputFilePath = "myinputfile.txt.gz"
chmodValue = 0o700

with jk_logging.ConsoleLogger.create() as log:

	resultFilePath = jk_packunpack.Unpacker.uncompressFile(
		filePath=inputFilePath,
		bDeleteOriginal=True,
		chModValue=chmodValue,
		log=log)

	print(resultFilePath)
```

For `chmodValue` you can specify a string such as "`rw-rw----`" or an instance of `jk_utils.ChModValue` as well.

Uncompressing will automatically detect the compression format used by inspecting the file extension.

### Pack a directory

The following example demonstrates how to pack the contents of a directory using `tar`:

```python
inputDirPath = "./my/example/dir"
outputTarFilePath = "./my/example-dir.tar"
chmodValue = 0o700

with jk_logging.ConsoleLogger.create() as log:

	jk_packunpack.Packer.tarDirContents(
		srcDirPath=inputDirPath,
		destTarFilePath=outputTarFilePath,
		chModValue=chmodValue,
		log=log)
```

For `chmodValue` you can specify a string such as "`rw-rw----`" or an instance of `jk_utils.ChModValue` as well.

### Unpack a directory

The following example demonstrates how to unpack a `tar` file to a directory:

```python
inputTarFilePath = "./my/example-dir.tar"
outputDirPath = "./my/new/dir"

with jk_logging.ConsoleLogger.create() as log:

	jk_packunpack.Unpacker.untarToDir(
		srcTarFilePath=inputTarFilePath,
		destDirPath=outputDirPath,
		log=log)
```
