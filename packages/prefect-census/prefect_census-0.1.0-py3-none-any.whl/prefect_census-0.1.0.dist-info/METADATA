## Welcome!

Prefect integrations for working with Census syncs

Census is an Operational Analytics platform that enables you to sync your trusted analytics data from your hub into operational tools that your business teams use on a daily basis.

For information on how to get started with Census, refer to the [Census docs](https://docs.getcensus.com/).

## Getting Started

### Python setup

Requires an installation of Python 3.7+.

We recommend using a Python virtual environment manager such as pipenv, conda or virtualenv.

These tasks are designed to work with Prefect 2.0. For more information about how to use Prefect, please refer to the [Prefect documentation](https://orion-docs.prefect.io/).

### Installation

Install `prefect-census` with `pip`:

```bash
pip install prefect-census
```

Then, register to [view the block](https://orion-docs.prefect.io/ui/blocks/) on Prefect Cloud:

```bash
prefect block register -m prefect_census
```

Note, to use the `load` method on Blocks, you must already have a block document [saved through code](https://orion-docs.prefect.io/concepts/blocks/#saving-blocks) or [saved through the UI](https://orion-docs.prefect.io/ui/blocks/).

### Get a Census API Key

You will need a Census API key to be able to use the integrations in this collection. 

For directions for how to generate a Census API key, refer to the [Getting API Access](https://docs.getcensus.com/basics/api#getting-api-access) section of the Census docs.

Once you have a Census API key, you can configure a Census Credentials block in the Prefect UI for use with the integrations in this collection. For information about how to configure a block in the Prefect UI, refer to the [Prefect docs](https://orion-docs.prefect.io/ui/blocks/).

### Write and run a flow
Trigger Census sync run and wait for completion:

```python
from prefect import flow

from prefect_census import CensusCredentials
from prefect_census.syncs import trigger_census_sync_run_and_wait_for_completion

@flow
def my_flow():
    ...
    creds = CensusCredentials(api_key="my_api_key")
    run_result = trigger_census_sync_run_and_wait_for_completion(
        credentials=creds,
        sync_id=42
    )
    ...

my_flow()
```

Get Census sync run info:
```python
from prefect import flow

from prefect_census import CensusCredentials
from prefect_census.runs import get_census_sync_run_info

@flow
def get_sync_run_info_flow():
    credentials = CensusCredentials(api_key="my_api_key")

    return get_census_sync_run_info(
        credentials=credentials,
        run_id=42
    )

get_sync_run_info_flow()
```

Call custom endpoint:
```python
from prefect import flow
from prefect_census import CensusCredentials
from prefect_census.client import CensusClient

@flow
def my_flow(sync_id):
    creds_block = CensusCredentials(api_key="my_api_key")

    client = CensusClient(api_key=creds_block.api_key.get_secret_value())
    response = client.call_endpoint(http_method="GET", path=f"/syncs/{sync_id}")
    return response

my_flow(42)
```
