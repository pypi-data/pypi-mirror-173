CoastSat is an open-source software toolkit written in Python that enables users to obtain time-series of shoreline position at any coastline worldwide from 30+ years (and growing) of publicly available satellite imagery.

### Latest updates

:arrow_forward: *(2022/08/01)* CoastSat 2.0 (major release):

+ new download function for Landsat images (better alignment between panchromatic and multispectral bands)
+ quality-control steps added for fully automated shoreline extraction
+ post-processing of the shorelne time-series, including despiking and computing seasonal-averages.

:arrow_forward: *(2022/07/20)* Option to switch off panchromatic sharpening on Landsat 7, 8 and 9 imagery.

:arrow_forward: *(2022/05/02)* Compatibility with Landsat 9 and Landsat Collection 2

### Project description

Satellite remote sensing can provide low-cost long-term shoreline data capable of resolving the temporal scales of interest to coastal scientists and engineers at sites where no in-situ field measurements are available. CoastSat enables the non-expert user to extract shorelines from Landsat 5, Landsat 7, Landsat 8, Landsat 9 and Sentinel-2 images.
The shoreline detection algorithm implemented in CoastSat is optimised for sandy beach coastlines. It combines a sub-pixel border segmentation and an image classification component, which refines the segmentation into four distinct categories such that the shoreline detection is specific to the sand/water interface.

The toolbox has four main functionalities:

1. assisted retrieval from Google Earth Engine of all available satellite images spanning the user-defined region of interest and time period.
2. automated extraction of shorelines from all the selected images using a sub-pixel resolution technique.
3. intersection of the 2D shorelines with user-defined shore-normal transects.
4. tidal correction using measured water levels and an estimate of the beach slope.
5. post-processing of the shoreline time-series, despiking and seasonal averaging.
6. validation example at Narrabeen
