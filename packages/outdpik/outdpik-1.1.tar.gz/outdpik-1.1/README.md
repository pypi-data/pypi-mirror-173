## What is it?
Outdpik is an open source Python package that provides different methods for outlier detection. 
It aims to be the fundamental high-level package for this purpose. 
Additionally, it offers visualization methods for the outlier analysis.

## Main Features
Here are just a few of the things that outdpik does well:

- It supports numpy arrays and pandas dataframes
- Multiple outlier detection techniques that can be combined
- Powerful visualizations
- Flexible at including one or more columns for the analysis

## Where to get it
The source code is currently hosted on GitHub at:
https://github.com/DanielPuentee/outdpik

Installer for the latest released version is available at the [Python
Package Index (PyPI)](https://pypi.org/project/outdpik)

```sh
# PyPI
pip install outdpik
```

## How to use outdpik ðŸ¤™
Examples of configuring and running outpdik:

```python
import outpdik as outdp
outdp = outdp()
```

We proceed to detect outliers returning a dictionary of numeric features and the outliers instances:

```python
outliers_dict = outdp.outliers(df = df, cols = "all")
```
Plotting advantages:

```python
outdp.plot_outliers(df = df, col = "x")
```
