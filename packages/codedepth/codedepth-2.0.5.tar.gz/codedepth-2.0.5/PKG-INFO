Description: # codedepth
        
        ###### Generates and graphs how many levels of imports are needed for each file in a project
        
        ##### Supported Languages
        - Python ðŸŸ¢
        - Lua ðŸŸ¢
        - JavaScript ðŸŸ¡ (Some styles of import statement may not be detected as a dependency)
        
        ## Dependencies
        
        You will need Graphviz v2.48.0 installed as an application - installation instructions can be found at https://graphviz.org/download/
        
        ## Quickstart
        
        From the command line (this will use default parameters and output a ranked directional graph as a PDF):
        
        ```
        > python -m codedepth <path of the target directory>
        ```
        The PDF will be generated in the working directory.
        If `<path of the target directory>` is omitted, the working directory will be used as the target.
        
        In a python script:
        
        ```python
        from codedepth import Scorer
        
        scorer = Scorer(r"<path of the target directory>")  # Replace this path string with your own
        
        # Calculates scores for all files in the target directory
        scorer.parse_all()
        
        """
        Generates a PDF saved in the working directory,
        containing a ranked directional graph of the file dependencies for the target directory.
        Once this is generated, it will be opened automatically.
        Also generates and saves a file containing the DOT code required to create the graph
        """
        scorer.plot_ranked()
        ```
