# Reviewcheck

Reviewcheck is a tool to stay up to date with your reviews on GitLab. You can
configure it to use any GitLab instance you have access to. The tool checks all
open merge requests in the repos chosen by you, and lets you know if there are
open threads that need your attention.

Reviewcheck is in active development.

## Installation

While the project is still in development, the best way to install it is by
cloning the repository and running `poetry run reviewcheck` from within it. You
will need to have poetry installed. The process looks as follows:

```
pip install poetry
git clone https://github.com/volvo-cars/Reviewcheck
cd reviewcheck
poetry run reviewcheck
```

## Documentation

For now, the only documentation is this README and the `--help` flag of the
program itself. A proper
[Wiki](https://github.com/volvo-cars/Reviewcheck/wiki) is
under construction.
