## Retarus Python SDK
The offical Python SDK provided by Retarus to contact our messaging services.

## Installation
Install from PyPi using pip, a package manager for Python. Minimum python version 3.8.

```bash
pip install retarus
```

Or you can download the [source code for the Retarus python SDK](https://github.com/retarus/retarus-python) and then build it with following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/retarus/retarus-python
cd retarus-python
python setup.py install
```

## Usage
The Python SDK implements different services that are offered by Retarus. First, you need to configure the SDK with your details.
```python
from retarus.base.configuration import Configuration

Configuration.set_auth(your_user_id, your_password)
Configuration.set_region(your_region)
# if its required for your service (eg. fax)
Configuration.customer_number = "my_customer_number"
```
Each service implements a client, so simply call "retarus.your_service" and create a client that provides your functionality.

```python
from retarus.fax.client import FaxClient

sdk = FaxClient()
```

## Region
The SDK also offers a simply way to select a region where your jobs should be processed. By default, the SDK will use the Europe region.

To configure your region:
```python
from retarus.base.configuration import Configuration
from retarus.base.region import Region
# if its required for your service (eg. fax)
Configuration.set_region(Region.Europe)
```

## Examples
Each service provides a small variety of example to get a better understanding off how to use their functionality. The examples can be found in the examples directory sorted by each service.
