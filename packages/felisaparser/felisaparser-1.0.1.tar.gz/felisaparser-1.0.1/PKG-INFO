Description: Convert Excel to CSV file =============== This project\'s aim consists
        of a library called **felisaparser** to convert an Excel file to CSV
        file. It is based on the Pandas Library and it consists of a class made
        up by just one method: *excel\_to\_csv()*. This parser, unlike the
        Pandas Method, directly dumps the data into a CSV file, without the need
        of loading a DataFrame.
