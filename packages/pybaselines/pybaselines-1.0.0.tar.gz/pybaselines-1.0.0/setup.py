"""The setup script.

All metadata now exists in setup.cfg. setup.py is now only needed to allow
for editable installs when using older versions of pip.


Notes on minimum required versions for dependencies:

numpy: >= 1.14 in order to use rcond=None with numpy.linalg.lstsq
scipy: >= 1.0 to use the blas function gbmv for banded matrix-vector dot product
pentapy: >= 1.0 to use solver #2
numba: >= 0.45 in order to cache jit-ed functions with parallel=True
