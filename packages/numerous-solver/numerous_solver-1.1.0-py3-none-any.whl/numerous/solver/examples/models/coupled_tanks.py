Solving a system of differential equations
===========================================

Numerous solver can be used to solve simple differential equations such as
:ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_exponential_approach.py`, but naturally it may also be used to solve systems of ODE´s.

Such an example is the Coupled tanks model. In the coupled tanks model, :math:`n_{tanks}` number of identical tanks are
connected through identical valves, which allow a liquid to flow from the initially full tank :math:`0`, to the final
tank, :math:`n_{tanks}`. The final tank has no outlet and all liquid stays there.

Coupled tanks model
----------------------------

The equation of mass conservation for tank :math:`i` is:

.. math::

    \frac{dm_i}{dt} = flow_{in,i} - flow_{out,i}


If tank :math:`i` is connected to tank :math:`i-1` at it's inlet and tank :math:`i+1` at it's outlet, and both inlet
and outlet are connected via identical valves with valve constant :math:`k_{valve}` then:

.. math::

    \frac{dm_i}{dt} = k (m_{i-1}) - m_{i})

The difference is for tank :math:`0` and tank :math:`n_{tanks}` where the inlet, respectively outlet is zero:

.. math::

    \frac{dm_0}{dt} = -k m_{1}

and

.. math::

    \frac{dm_{n_{tanks}}}{dt} = k m_{n_{tanks}-1}


Implementation in numerous solver
------------------------------------

This model is implemented in the :class:`CoupledTanks` model's :meth:`diff` function below. The model requires an
:class:`~solver.interface.Interface`. The interface needs to specify the following methods:

* :meth:`get_deriv`
* :meth:`get_states`,
* :meth:`set_states`,

which have been implemented in the :class:`CoupledTanksInterface` below.

Examples
--------------
Below is an example code that runs the model, and creates a plot for `n_tanks=5`.
