## Python SensorBucket package

This repository is a Python package that provides interaction with the SensorBucket API.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the Sensorbucket Python package.

```bash
pip install sensorbucket
```

## Usage and Documentation

Below is a quickstart. Also see the documentation: https://sensorbucket.gitlab.io/pysensorbucket .

```python
import sensorbucket

sb = sensorbucket.Facade("https://api.sensorbucket.nl", "account_email", "account_password")

measurements = sb.get_measurements(
    3,                              # Location ID
    "air_temperature_celsius",      # MeasurementType Name or ID
    "2021-05-17T13:33:45.32049Z",   # Start DateTime or ISO8601 string
    "2021-05-17T13:33:48.32049Z"    # Start DateTime or ISO8601 string
)
```

To use the data with Pandas, simply create a dataframe with the return value of `get_measurements`:

```python
import pandas

# Fetch measurements as above
# measurements = sb.get_measurements(...)

df = pandas.DataFrame(measurements)

# Use dataframe as you normally would
print(df["value"].mean())
```
