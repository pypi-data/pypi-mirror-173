# autotiling
This script uses the [i3ipc-python library](https://github.com/altdesktop/i3ipc-python)
to switch the layout splith/splitv depending on the currently focused window
dimensions. It works on both sway and i3 window managers.

Inspired by https://github.com/olemartinorg/i3-alternating-layout.

## PLEASE DO READ THIS

The script does one thing: it checks the window height / width ratio, and executes
the equivalent of either `swaymsg splitv` or `swaymsg splith`. Nothing less, nothing more. Yes, it may make
stacking and tabbed layouts behave oddly. No, nothing can be done about it. If you like stacking/tabbed layouts,
you may use them on workspaces with autotiling turned off (`--workspaces` argument). Do not submit issues about it. 

For instance, you may configure autotiling to work on odd workspaces, but not on even:

```text
### Autostart
  exec autotiling -w 1 3 5 7 9
```

## Installation

The script has been packaged for the following distributions:

 [![Packaging
 status](https://repology.org/badge/vertical-allrepos/autotiling.svg)](https://repology.org/project/autotiling/versions)

 [![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/autotiling.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/autotiling)

Installing manually:

1. Install the `python-i3ipc>=2.0.1` package (or whatever it's called in your Linux
    distribution);
2. save the `main.py` file anywhere, rename to `autotiling`, make executable, move to your bin folder;
3. add `exec_always autotiling` to the `~/.config/sway/config` or `exec_always --no-startup-id
   autotiling` to the `~/.config/i3/config` file.

## Usage

```text
$ autotiling -h
usage: autotiling [-h] [-d] [-v] [-w [WORKSPACES ...]] [-e [EVENTS ...]]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -d, --debug           print debug messages to stderr
  -v, --version         display version information
  -w [WORKSPACES ...], --workspaces [WORKSPACES ...]
                        restricts autotiling to certain workspaces; example: autotiling --workspaces 8
                        9
  -e [EVENTS ...], --events [EVENTS ...]
                        list of events to trigger switching split orientation; default: WINDOW MODE
```

### Events

Changing event subscription has already been the objective of several pull request. To avoid doing this again and again,
starting from v1.6 you may specify them in the `-e` | `--events` argument. If no value given, the script will subscribe
to `Event.WINDOW` and `Event.MODE`, as if it was executed with `autotiling -e WINDOW MODE`. See  
[altdesktop/i3ipc-python`](https://github.com/altdesktop/i3ipc-python/blob/a670f24e7e04f509de8161cf760afe929c22ae93/i3ipc/events.py#L12)
for event enumeration.
