E.g. `blog/*` means any files in the `blog` folder (but not in any of its subfolders)\n- `**/*` means all files in a given folder and subfolders of any depth. E.g. `blog/**/*` includes all files in the `blog` folder and its subfolders.\n**Note**: The most specific rule takes precendence.","additionalProperties":{"type":"string"}},"head":{"type":"array","markdownDescription":"This is a list of tags to inject in the `<head>` section of all your pages.
