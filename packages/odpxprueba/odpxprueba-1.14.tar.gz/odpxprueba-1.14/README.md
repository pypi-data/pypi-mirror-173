## What is it?
Outdpik is an open source Python package that provides different methods for outlier detection. 
It aims to be the fundamental high-level package for this purpose. 
Additionally, it offers visualization methods for the outlier analysis.

## Main Features
Here are just a few of the things that outdpik does well:

- It supports numpy arrays and pandas dataframes
- Multiple outlier detection techniques that can be combined
- Powerful visualizations
- Flexible at including one or more columns for the analysis
