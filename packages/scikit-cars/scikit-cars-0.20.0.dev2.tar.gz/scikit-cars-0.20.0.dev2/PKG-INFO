# scikit-cars: Image processing in Python

This package is a scikit-image fork to include the use of SAD for channels distance in SLIC algorithm.
See [https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image](https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image) for the original package.

**Warning** Even if the package is called scikit-cars, the python module name is still skimage.

## Installation

Use pip to install this package:
````
pip install scikit-cars
````

## Installation from source

Install dependencies using:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, install scikit-image using:

```
$ pip install .
```

If you plan to develop the package, you may run it directly from source:

```
$ pip install -e .  # Do this once to add package to Python path
```

Every time you modify Cython files, also run:

```
$ python setup.py build_ext -i  # Build binary extensions
```
