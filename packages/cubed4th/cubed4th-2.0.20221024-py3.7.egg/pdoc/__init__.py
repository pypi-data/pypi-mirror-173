# What is pdoc?

pdoc auto-generates API documentation that follows your project's Python module hierarchy.
It can be used as a command-line application as well as a library.

*pdoc the command-line application* can be used to render a project's
documentation as static HTML files. It also includes a live-reloading
web server to preview changes.

*pdoc the library* provides types and functions for accessing the public
documentation of a Python module. This includes modules, functions,
classes and variables.

# How does pdoc work?

In a nutshell, pdoc takes a Python module name as input, imports it, creates a `pdoc.doc.Module` object
that extracts all docstrings, and passes it to the HTML template for rendering.

This implies a few things:

 - Your documentation lives right by your code, not in extra files.
 - The structure of the generated documentation matches that of your Python package:
   There is a direct mapping from say `mypackage/helpers.py` to `mypackage/helpers.html`.
   As such, pdoc works best with small projects and projects that have a well-defined hierarchy.

# Example: `shelter.py`

For this example, we have some code to keep track of the dogs in our local animal shelter.
Here's our current code:

```python
"""
This module deals with all animals. So far, only dogs are implemented.

# TODO

 - Add the rest of the animals.

"""

class Dog:
    name: str
    """The name of this dog. May contain non-ASCII characters."""
    friends: list["Dog"]
    """Friends this dog has made."""

    def __init__(self, name: str):
        """Make a Dog without any friends (yet)."""
        self.name = name
        self.friends = []

    def bark(self, loud: bool = True):
        """*woof*"""

```

The docstrings we've added aren't pdoc-specific, we just use modern Python 3 conventions.
pdoc will later take your module, class, function and variable docstrings and render them
into a standalone HTML document.

Additionally, all docstrings are interpreted as Markdown.
For example, the todo list in the example will be rendered with bullet points in your documentation.


## Invoking pdoc

Let's run pdoc on this module to see what we get:

```shell
pdoc ./shelter.py
```

This opens a browser with our module documentation. If we edit `shelter.py` now,
the page will reload automatically. Once we are happy with our changes, we can export our documentation
to HTML files:

```shell
pdoc -o ./docs ./shelter.py
```

This will create an HTML file at `docs/shelter.html` which contains our module documentation.

## Configuring pdoc

We can configure some parts of pdoc's output via command line flags.
For example, we can add a project logo to the documentation:

```shell
pdoc --logo "https://placedog.net/300?random" ./shelter.py
```

To get a list of all available rendering options, run:

```shell
pdoc --help
```

Library users can call `pdoc.render.configure` to configure rendering.


## Editing pdoc's HTML template

For more advanced customization, we can edit pdoc's
[default HTML template](https://github.com/mitmproxy/pdoc/blob/main/pdoc/templates/default/module.html.jinja2),
which uses the
[Jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/) templating language.

Let's assume you want to replace the logo with a custom button. We first find the right location in the template by searching
for "logo", which shows us that the logo is defined in a Jinja2 block named `nav_title`.
We now extend the default template by creating a file titled `module.html.jinja2` in the current directory
 with the following contents:

```html+jinja
{% extends "default/module.html.jinja2" %}
{% block nav_title %}
<button>Donate dog food</button>
{% endblock %}
```

We then specify our custom template directory when invoking pdoc...

```shell
pdoc -t . ./shelter.py
```

...and the updated documentation â€“ with button â€“ renders! ðŸŽ‰

See [`examples/`](https://github.com/mitmproxy/pdoc/tree/main/examples/)
for more examples.

# How can I ... ?

## ...add documentation?

In Python, objects like modules, functions and classes have
a special attribute named `__doc__` which contains that object's
*docstring*.  The docstring comes from a special placement of a string
in your source code.  For example, the following code shows how to
define a function with a docstring and access the contents of that
docstring:

```python
>>> def test():
...     """This is a docstring."""
...     pass
...
>>> test.__doc__
'This is a docstring.'
```

Something similar can be done for classes and modules too. For classes,
the docstring should come on the line immediately following `class
...`. For modules, the docstring should start on the first line of
the file. These docstrings are what you see for each module, class,
function and method listed in the documentation produced by pdoc.

## ...document variables?

Python itself [does not attach docstrings to
variables](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0224/). For example:

```python
variable = "SomeValue"
"""Docstring for variable."""
```

The resulting `variable` will have no `__doc__` attribute.
To compensate, pdoc will read the abstract syntax tree (an abstract representation of the source code)
and include all assignment statements immediately followed by a docstring. This approach is not formally standardized,
but followed by many tools, including Sphinx's autodoc extension in case you ever decide to migrate off pdoc.

Something similar is done for instance variables, which are either type-annotated in the class
or defined in a class's `__init__`. Here is an example showing both conventions detected by pdoc:

```python
class GoldenRetriever(Dog):
    name: str
    """Full Name"""

    def __init__(self):
        self.weight: int = 10
        """Weight in kilograms"""
```


If you would like to distinguish an instance variable from a class variable,
you can use [`typing.ClassVar`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.ClassVar):

```python
class GoldenRetriever(Dog):
    breed_code: ClassVar[str] = "GOLD"
    """International breed code (same for all instances)"""
    name: str
    """Full Name (different for each instance)"""
```

## ...control what is documented?

The public interface of a module is determined through one of two
ways.

- If `__all__` is defined in the module, then all identifiers in that list will be considered public.
   No other identifiers will be considered as public.
- If `__all__` is not defined, then pdoc will consider all members public that
   1. do not start with an underscore
   2. and are defined in the current module (i.e. they are not imported).

In general, we recommend keeping these conventions:

- If you want to document a private member, consider making it public.
- If you want to hide a public member, consider making it private.
- If you want to document a special `__dunder__` method, the recommended way to do so is
  to not document the dunder method specifically, but add some usage examples in the class documentation.

As a last resort, you can override pdoc's behavior with a custom module template (see
[*Editing pdoc's HTML template*](#editing-pdocs-html-template)).
You can find an example at
[`examples/custom-template/module.html.jinja2`](https://github.com/mitmproxy/pdoc/blob/main/examples/custom-template/module.html.jinja2).

### ...exclude submodules from being documented?

If you would like to exclude specific submodules from the documentation, the recommended way is to specify `__all__` as
shown in the previous section. Alternatively, you can pass negative regular expression `!patterns` as part of the
module specification. Each pattern removes all previously specified (sub)module names that match. For example, the following
invocation documents `foo` and all submodules of `foo`, but not `foo.bar`:

```
pdoc foo !foo.bar
```

Likewise, `pdoc pdoc !pdoc.` would document the pdoc module itself, but none of its submodules. Patterns are always
matched on the final module name, even if modules are passed as file paths.

## ...link to other identifiers?

In your documentation, you can link to other identifiers by enclosing them in backticks:
<code>\`pdoc\`</code> will link to `pdoc`.
When linking to identifiers in other modules, the identifier name must be fully qualified.
For example, <code>\`pdoc.doc.Doc\`</code> will be automatically linked to `pdoc.doc.Doc`,
while <code>\`Doc\`</code> only works within the `pdoc.doc` module.

pdoc will link all identifiers that are rendered in the current run.
This means that you need to run `pdoc module_a module_b` to have interlinking between module_a and module_b.
If you run `pdoc module_a` followed by `pdoc module_b`, there will be no cross-linking between the two modules.

## ...change the item order?

By default, documentation items are sorted in order of (first) appearance in the source code.
This means that if you want to move a particular function to the beginning of your documentation,
you need to move it there in your source code. This is not only useful to the readers of your documentation,
but also useful to the consumers of your source code.

## ...use numpydoc or Google docstrings?

While pdoc prefers docstrings that are plain Markdown,
it also understands numpydoc and Google-style docstrings,
including a limited subset of reStructuredText (as used by Sphinx).
If your documentation follows one of these styles, you can:

1. Run `pdoc --docformat ...` to enable a particular docstring flavor globally, or
2. Add `__docformat__ = "google"` at the top-level of the module you are documenting.
   The following values are supported: `google`, `numpy`, and `restructuredtext`.
   `google` and `numpy` are both treated as a superset of `restructuredtext`.

pdoc does not implement the full reStructuredText specification and does not plan on doing so.
Adding additional syntax elements is usually easy.
If you feel that pdoc doesn't parse a docstring element properly, please amend
`pdoc.docstrings` and send us a pull request!

## ...render math formulas?

Run `pdoc --math`, and pdoc will render formulas in your docstrings. See
[`math_demo`](https://pdoc.dev/docs/math/math_demo.html) for details.

## ...add my project's logo?

See [*Configuring pdoc*](#configuring-pdoc).

## ...pass arguments to the Jinja2 template?

If you need to pass additional data to pdoc's Jinja2 templates,
you can use system environment variables.
For example,
[`examples/custom-template/module.html.jinja2`](https://github.com/mitmproxy/pdoc/blob/main/examples/custom-template/module.html.jinja2)
shows how to include a version number in the rendered HTML.

## ...include Markdown files?

You can include external Markdown files in your documentation by using reStructuredText's
`.. include::` directive. For example, you can include your README in `__init__.py` like this:

```python
"""
.. include:: README.md
"""
__docformat__ = "restructuredtext"
```

Make sure that you either specify `__docformat__`
or pass `--docformat`. pdoc processes plain Markdown by default,
`.. include::` is only evaluated for [`google`, `numpy`, or `restructuredtext`
docstrings](#use-numpydoc-or-google-docstrings).



## ...integrate pdoc into other systems?

pdoc's HTML and CSS are written in a way that the default template can be easily adjusted
to produce standalone HTML fragments that can be embedded in other systems.
This makes it possible to integrate pdoc with almost every CMS or static site generator.
The only limitation is that you need to retain pdoc's directory structure
if you would like to link between modules.

To do so, [create a custom `frame.html.jinja2` template](#editing-pdocs-html-template) which only emits CSS and the main
page contents instead of a full standalone HTML document:
```html+jinja
{% block content %}{% endblock %}

{% filter minify_css %}
    {% block style %}
        {# The same CSS files as in pdoc's default template, except for layout.css.
        You may leave out Bootstrap Reboot, which corrects inconsistences across browsers
        but may conflict with you website's stylesheet. #}
        <style>{% include "resources/bootstrap-reboot.min.css" %}</style>
        <style>{% include "syntax-highlighting.css" %}</style>
        <style>{% include "theme.css" %}</style>
        <style>{% include "content.css" %}</style>
    {% endblock %}
{% endfilter %}
```

This should be enough to produce HTML files that can be embedded into other pages.
All CSS selectors are prefixed with `.pdoc` so that pdoc's page style does not interfere with the rest of your website.

You can find a full example for mkdocs in [`examples/mkdocs`](https://github.com/mitmproxy/pdoc/tree/main/examples/mkdocs/).

# Docstring Inheritance

pdoc extends the standard use of docstrings in two important ways:
by introducing variable docstrings (see [*How can I document variables?*](#document-variables)),
and by allowing functions and classes to inherit docstrings and type annotations.

This is useful to not unnecessarily repeat information. Consider this example:

```python
class Dog:
    def bark(self, loud: bool) -> None:
        """
        Make the dog bark. If `loud` is True,
        use full volume. Not supported by all breeds.
        """

class GoldenRetriever(Dog):
    def bark(self, loud: bool) -> None:
        print("Woof Woof")
```

In Python, the docstring for `GoldenRetriever.bark` is empty, even though one was
defined in `Dog.bark`. If pdoc generates documentation for the above
code, then it will automatically attach the docstring for `Dog.bark` to
`GoldenRetriever.bark` if it does not have a docstring.

# Limitations

**Markdown and PDF Output**

pdoc currently only supports HTML as an output format.
We would be happy to accept contributions for Markdown and PDF.

# Using pdoc as a library

pdoc provides the high-level `pdoc.pdoc()` interface shown below, but it is also possible to create `pdoc.doc.Module`
objects directly to modify them before rendering.
You can find an example in [`examples/library-usage`](https://github.com/mitmproxy/pdoc/tree/main/examples/library-usage).
