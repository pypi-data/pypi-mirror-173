class AudioFile:

    """
    Represents a audio file that can be played by a output track.
    The reason why this is a class is so that we can have some unique
    configurations for each audio file.

    Attributes
    ----------
    `path` : str
        The path to the audio file.
    `repeat` : Union[int, Callable]
        How many times should the audio file be looped. Defaults to 0 which means play it once.
        This attribute can also be a callable that returns the actual integer value.
    `vol` : float
        The volume to use when playing this audio file. Defaults to 1.0 which is 100%.
        The volume can obviously still be overwritten if the volume has been manually changed
        in the middle of playing the audio file.
    `on_end` : Optional[Callable]
        A user supplied callback function that gets called every time the audio file ends. Defaults to None.
        The function must accept two arguments, the first one is the `AudioFile` instance and
        the second one is the remaining counter for `repeat`. If it's 0 then that means
        that's the last time the audio file will ever be played.
