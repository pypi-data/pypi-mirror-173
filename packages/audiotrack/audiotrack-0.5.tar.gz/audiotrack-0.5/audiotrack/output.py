Contains the main `OutputTrack` class. An `OutputTrack` is what's responsible for opening a constant `sd.OutputStream` in the background. 
We can then play audio by putting some ndarray data into the output track's queue.

class OutputTrack:
    """
    An `OutputTrack` is a type of track that lets you play audio by putting ndarray data
    into the output track's queue. Multiple output tracks can overlap each other and play
    audio on top of one another but each output track is only capable of playing one audio.

    Notes
    -----
    - The shape of the ndarray being fed into a output track must be the same shape as
    the output track's `shape` attribute.

    Attributes
    ----------
    `name` : str
        The name of this track. It doesn't have to conform to any guidelines.
    `callback` : Callable
        A user supplied function that takes in two arguments, the first argument is the current
        output track and the second argument is the ndarray that is currently about to be played.
        The function can then modify this ndarray and return it back in order to play the modified ndarray.
        There should always be a returned ndarray.
    `queue_size` : int
        The maximum number of frames to put in the queue. Defaults to `20`. Generally you don't
        have to change this.
    `samplerate` : Optional[int]
        The initial samplerate of this OutputTrack. Defaults to None which is `config.default_output_track_samplerate`.
        Note that the samplerate can be changed by calling `self.update_samplerate(rate: int)`
    `blocksize` : int
        The blocksize to be fed into `sd.OutputStream`. Defaults to `None` which means to calculate it
        based on the sample rate of the track.
    `device` : Optional[Union[int, str]]
        The device to use for this OutputTrack. Passed onto `sd.OutputTrack`. Defaults to None.
    `dtype` : str
        The dtype to be fed into `sd.OutputStream`. Defaults to `"float32"`
    `stream_parameters` : Optional[dict]
        Extra parameters to be passed onto `sd.OutputStream`. Defaults to None.

    Audio Attributes
    ----------------
    `vol` : float
        The initial volume of the track. Defaults to 1 which is 100%. You can go higher than 1 but it
        will start sounding like absolute dog shit.
