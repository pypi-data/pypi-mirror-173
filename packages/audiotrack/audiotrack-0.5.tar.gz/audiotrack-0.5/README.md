# Audiotrack

A object oriented multi purpose audio library built with python. At it's core, audiotrack is just a fancy extension to [sounddevice's](https://python-sounddevice.readthedocs.io/en/0.4.5/) stream classes.

## Installation

To install audiotrack, simply run `pip install audiotrack` on your terminal.

## Tracks

Think of tracks as layers in a video editing software like premiere. Premiere can have multiple audio tracks playing the same audio at once, and audiotrack can do it as well with the use of the `OutputTrack` class.

But audiotrack goes beyond output, audiotrack also supports the `InputTrack` class which provides a essential method called `.read()`. This method returns data coming from a input device such as a microphone. You can use this data to record your microphone, perform real time speech recognition, or even just pipe it into a `OutputTrack` to monitor your voice in real time.

### Callbacks

Each track supports a `callback` parameter which accepts a function. That function can then modify either the incoming input from a microphone before it gets returned to `.read()` or the outgoing audio data before it goes to the output device.

This is useful if you want to let's say remove background noise from a input device before passing it onto somewhere or if you simply just want to add a sound effect to a piece of audio data.
