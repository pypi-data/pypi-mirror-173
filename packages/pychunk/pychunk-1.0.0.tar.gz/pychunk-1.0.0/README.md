# PyChunk

A Python library to chunk list based on number of items or number of chunks

## Why?

Python doesn't come with out of box chunking functionality for lists. Hence I thought of writing a library instead of referring stackoverflow everytime

## Tech Used

1. Peotry for package management
2. Pytest for testing
3. Mypy for static code checking
