    <h1>Logics</h1>
    A tiny, sandboxed, secure and extendable formula language with a flavor of Python.
</div>

## About

Logics is a tiny formula language, with the goal to provide equal syntax and semantics for different runtime contexts.

- [logics-js](logics-js) is a pure JavaScript implementation of Logics provided as npm-package.
- [logics-py](logics-py) is a pure Python implementation of Logics provided as PyPI-package.

Both packages are under recent development and not stable right now. They are maintained in separate version numbers.

## Features

- Python-like expression syntax, including list comprehensions
- Python-inspired type system for all JSON-serializable types
- Some Logics-specific specialities
- Separate implementations in JavaScript and Python with equal syntax and similar semantics
- Secure, running in a sandboxed environment apart from the host language
- Provides a set of functions to be used in expressions
- Extendable to custom functions
