# UseCase exports

This directory contains datasets that were generated by a specific use case for an external usage.
This is where you typically put predictions.

UseCase exports structure:
```
use_cases
|_ <use_case_name>
  |_ exports
    |_ <export_name>
      |_ <export_run_id>
        |_ export_file_1
        |_ export_file_2
```

For example:
```
use_cases
|_ my_super_use_case
  |_ exports
    |_ predictions
      |_ run_2020_01_01
        |_ export.csv
```
