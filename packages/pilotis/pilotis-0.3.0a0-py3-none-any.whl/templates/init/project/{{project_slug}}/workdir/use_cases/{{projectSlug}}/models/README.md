# UseCase models

This directory contains Machine Learning models trained by a specific use case.
Note that one model for a business case may result in several models (in terms of files generated by a framework).

UseCase models structure:
```
use_cases
|_ <use_case_name>
  |_ models
    |_ <model_name>
      |_ <model_run_id>
        |_ model_file_1
        |_ model_file_2
```

For example:
```
use_cases
|_ my_super_use_case
  |_ models
    |_ churn_prediction
      |_ run_2020_01_01
        |_ model_1.pkl
        |_ model_2.pkl
```
