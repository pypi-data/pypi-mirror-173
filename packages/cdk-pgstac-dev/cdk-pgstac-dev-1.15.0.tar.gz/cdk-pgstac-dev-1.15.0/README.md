## Release

Versioning is automatically handled via [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) and [Semantic Release](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/).

A warning: If you rebase `main`, you must ensure that the commits referenced by tags point to commits that are within the `main` branch. If a commit references a commit that is no longer on the `main` branch, Semantic Release will fail to detect the correct version of the project. [More information](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/issues/1121#issuecomment-517945233).
