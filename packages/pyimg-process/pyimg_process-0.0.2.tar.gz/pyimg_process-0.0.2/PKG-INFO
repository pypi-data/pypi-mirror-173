# pyimg-process

The **pyimg-process** package is a Python library that provides simple and expressive manual image processing techniques. It aims to provide an easy toolkit for begginer users in order to develop their image treatment projects. It is already well on its way towards this goal.


## Main Features

Here are some of the implemented features: 

- Easy way to read, write and display images
- Image resizing to any dimension
- RGB to grayscale conversion
- Image blurring and sharpening methods
- Image filtering by thresholding
- Visualization of the histogram of the image
- Inverse image obtention

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install pyimage.

```bash
pip install pyimage
```

## Usage

```python
import pyimage

# loads 'image' from 'path'
img = pyimage.Methods.read_image('path','image')

# converts img to grayscale
gray = pyimage.Methods.grayscale(img)

# sharpen img with a 100x100 kernel
sharp = pyimage.Methods.sharpen(img, 100)

# displays both images
pyimage.Methods.show_image(img)
pyimage.Methods.show_image(gray)
pyimage.Methods.show_image(sharp)
```
