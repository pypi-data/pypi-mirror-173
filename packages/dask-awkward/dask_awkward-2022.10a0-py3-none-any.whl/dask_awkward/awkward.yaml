  # This option is for cases where new array collections are created
  # with unknown metadata. The default setting is to compute the first
  # partition of the collection so that we can define the metadata. If
  # this option is set to False then collections with unknown metadata
  # will be instantiated with the `_meta` attribute set to an "empty"
  # typetracer, which is an empty awkward array.

  # This option is executing the column projection optimization. It's
  # currently implemented as a brute force search for columns that are
  # required for the task graph to complete without raising an
  # IndexError (each column is held out and the metadata task graph is
  # computed as a requirement test); because of this search method the
  # optimization can be slow, so it is configurable.
