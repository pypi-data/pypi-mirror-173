Dear Matt,

Regarding your recent **criticisms** of cyclists, it pains me to admit that at least 90% of my fellow cyclists are not only scofflaws, but also genuine morons with no regard for the fact that the roads were just not built for us, that we cyclists are late-comers to the infrastructure that imperfectly suits us.  Yes, morons (cyclists talking on cell phones? yeah I've seen that). 

While we may have the legal right to be on the roads and that we qualify as "traffic", we need to realize that we are still not first-citizens of the roads.  And it doesn't exactly do me any good to be legally in the right if I'm bug-squash on the grill of an oncoming motorized vehicle because of  a mistake on the driver's part.
