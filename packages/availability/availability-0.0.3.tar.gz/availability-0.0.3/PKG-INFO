# Availability
Python type for working with ranges of datetimes


Use Availability to calculate ranges of datetimes.  A range consists of a start and end time that can be added or subtracted from another range.

```
availability = Availabilty([
AvailabilityRange(start_time=datetime.datetime(2022,11,1), end_time=datetime.datetime(2022,11,31,23,59,59)),
], padding_time_before=5, padding_time_after=10)

availability -= AvailabilityRange(start_time=datetime.datetime(2022,11,8), end_time=datetime.datetime(2022,11,10))
```

`pip install availibility`


### Weird Behaviors

# Jumping forward with DST

When working with availability ranges that exist in a jump, they will be converted to the "jumped time".  So 2:30 would become 3:30 since there isn't technically a 2:30 on that day.
