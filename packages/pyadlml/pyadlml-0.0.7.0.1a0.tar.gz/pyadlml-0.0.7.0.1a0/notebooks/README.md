# Overview

The notebooks include educational examples, dataset cleaning, models that are benchmarked and
a set of replications. At the end of this document resources are listed that I found to be
useful.


# Examples

The example notebooks serve an educational purpose to show how models can be build in 
conjunction with  *pyadlml*. The notebooks
review a bit of theory backing the models, followed by a simple proof of concept and 
an application to one dataset.

- [RNN]()
- [HMM]()
- [HSMM]()

# Datasets

Most datasets are in a desolate state. To properly evaluate models cleaned up dataset versions 
are used. By passing the parameter `load_cleaned=True` to the `fetch_dataset` method a preprocessed 
dataset is loaded. The reasoning for the measures and cleaning steps taken are tracked for all datasets:

- [Aras]()
- [Mitlab]()
- [Tuebingen 2019]()
- [Casas Aruba]() 
- [MITLab]() 
- [Casas Milan]() 

# Models

This is a thoroughly gathered performance comparison between many models. Emphasize is on
the performance and not learning. For each category a survey is done to get retrieve the
best performing models. The total survey provides a ranking of the overall best performing
models.

- I.I.d.
    - [Random Forest]()
    - [SVM]()
    - [Naive Bayes]()
    - [Survey]()    
- Sequential
    - Discrete
        - ordered
        - timeslice
            - [Recurrent Neural Network]()
            - [InecptionTime]()
            - [Rocket]()
            - [Bernoulli Hidden Markov Model]()
            - [Bernoulli Semi-Hidden Markov Model]()
            - [Continuous Hidden Markov Model]()
        - [Survey]()
    - Continuous
        - ordered 
        - temporal points
            - marked temporal hawkes process
            - marked temporal poisson process
        - [Survey]()
    - [Total Survey]()
