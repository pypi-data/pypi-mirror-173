Datasets
========


.. warning::
    Project is under heavy development. Dataset information is wrong or incomplete. I am
    going to update this as soon as possible.



This page presents an exhaustive list of all supported datasets.
The attributes ``Activities`` and ``Devices`` follow the schemata  ``#x/#X``, where ``#x`` is
the number of distinct activities and ``#X`` is the total number of activity recordings.
For example ``activities: 7/263`` means the dataset has 263 recordings of 7 different activities.
In addition, the activity ``Coverage`` per dataset is given in the same way. Hereby the first number
indicates the total time covered by activities for the dataset. The second number represents the amount of
datapoints where an activity label is available. The activity coverage can be taken as a measure for a datasets quality.
Finally, the ``DeviceType`` informs whether the dataset contains  *boolean*, *numerical* or *categorical* devices.

If a cleaned version is available for a dataset it is indicated. The data cleaning process is documented
in jupyter `notebooks`_. To get a feel for the datasets this is the recommended place to look.

:From: 2008-02-25 00:20:14
:To: 2008-03-23 19:04:58
:Activities: 7/263
:Devices: 14/2620
:DeviceType: boolean
:Coverage: 0.88/0.77

To download the dataset execute

.. code:: python

    >>> from pyadlml.dataset import fetch_amsterdam
    >>> data = fetch_amsterdam()


.. note::

    A cleaned version of the amsterdam dataset is available and can be loaded with

    .. code:: python

        clean_data = fetch_amsterdam(load_cleaned=True)

    The cleaned dataset can be reproduced with the `amsterdam notebook`_.


.. warning::

    The amsterdam's data cleaning removes intermediate and shifts successive days. Consequently, week-days
    can not be used as features since the timing of device activations and activities do
    not correspond to the correct days anymore.
