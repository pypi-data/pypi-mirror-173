# Nevia
An open source framework for Forward Modeling of Wave Propagation

Nevia is an easy to use, robust and accurate Python (For Matlab distrubution visit here) package, that mainly developed by Arash Rezaei Nevisi.
We hope to become the most widely used modeling package in the geophysical world.

We strongly invite the contributors to extend our unsolved problems mentioned below:
- Forward modeling using the Spectral or Finite element method.
- Forward modeling for 3D models.
- Include variable grid distance (Especially the sub-gridding method) to our Finite-Difference engine.
- Include Topography in our Finite-Difference engine.
- Improve PML absorbing layer in our Finite-Difference engine.
- Elastodynamics (First-order) equations.
- Any other suggestions.
