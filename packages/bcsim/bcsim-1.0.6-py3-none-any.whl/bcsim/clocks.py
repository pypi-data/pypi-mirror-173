class FastClock(Clock):
    """A fast-cycling subclass of `Clock`.

    The `FastClock` class takes advantage of a repeating pattern. At
    each 12-hr interval, all the balls in the clock are in the
    reservoir. If you start with a fresh clock and brute-force cycle it
    for 720 minutes (12-hrs), then you get what I call a permutation
    vector in the reservoir. You can now treat each ball number in the
    reservoir as an index (position) for the movement of balls every
    12-hrs.

    For example, if cycling a fresh clock 12-hrs results in ball #10
    ending up in position #2, that means every 12-hrs the ball in
    position #10 will migrate to position #2. Using two Python lists, we
    can now cycle the clock for 12-hrs each `tick()`, rather then
    1-minute for each `tick()`. The speed gains in clock cycling are
    dramatic.

    Arguments
    ---------
    size : `int`
        The number of simulated balls in the clock reservoir.

    Attributes
    ----------
    B : [`int`]
        On initialization, the benchmark reservoir is copied into a
        Python list as *B*.
    P : [`int`]
        After a fresh clock is cycled for 720 minutes, the reservoir
        (now the permutation vector) is copied into a Python list as
        *P*.
    R : [`int`]
        A copy of the initial state of the clock, with the balls in
        `0 -> n-1` order.
    T : [`int`]
        *T* is a list used to cycle a `FastClock` 1-day at a time. The
        reservoir is copied into *T* based on the permutation vector;
        *T* and *R* are then swapped; and the process is repeated.
