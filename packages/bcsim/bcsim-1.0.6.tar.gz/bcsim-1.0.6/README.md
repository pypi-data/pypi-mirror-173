# Ball Clock Simulator

## A note to developers

If you're just using bcsim, then carry on!

If you're a developer looking to fork this repository and modify bcsim,
there are two important considerations:

1. I used [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency and publication
   management when developing bcsim. Poetry is well behaved and if you're a
   Python developer you should check it out. It installs itself in a virtual
   environment, uninstalls cleanly and easily, and doesn't require `sudo` for
   installation. To install poetry, run this command:

   ```shell
   curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
   ```

2. I've included a file called `global-gitignore.txt` which is a copy of the
   `.gitignore` I placed in my home directory and configured globally for all
   my development projects. The `global-gitignore.txt` file reflects my
   development setup (for example using tools like vscode), but yours may be
   different. Just cherry-pick any necessary elements from
   `global-gitignore.txt` for your own use.

   *Details on gitignore files are available on
   [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/ignoring-files).*

## Installation

The Ball Clock Simulator is lightweight, pure Python, with no third-party
dependencies.

```text
pip3 install bcsim  
```

## Usage

To display the help menu, run:

```text
bcsim -h
```

## Documentation

See: [Ball Clock API Documentation](https://geozeke.github.io/bcsim)

## What Is A Ball Clock?

Start with this [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7K6GIBWPQw)
that describes exactly what a Ball Clock is. It gives you a good overview of
how it works.

## What Does This Program Do?

I have one of the clocks shown in the video (I also have one of [these
clocks](https://www.idle-tyme.com/)).

One day, I was staring at it and I thought: *When the clock shows 1:00 and all
the balls are in the input tray (what I call the reservoir) they're in a
certain order. I wonder how long the clock has to run before the balls return
to that same ordering again.*

It turns out I'm not even close to the first person to ask this question. The
[Ball Clock Problem](http://www.chilton.com/~jimw/ballclk.html) has been
rattling around the internet as at least as far back as 1995. Just go to
GitHub, type "Ball Clock", and you'll get lots of hits. Like those simulations,
my program runs the clock and counts the number of days that pass until the
balls all return to their original starting order in the reservoir.

## How Is This Ball Clock Simulator Different?

It's written in Python.

In the [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7K6GIBWPQw), starting
around 2:10, you'll hear a description of a little plastic lever (what I call
the "cam") that prevents the balls in the 5-min rail from colliding with the
balls in the hr-rail when the clock strikes 1:00. The physical clock would have
issues if that cam were not present, but there's no need for it in a virtual
clock. I've been able to reproduce the results of others, which assume the cam
is not present, but the combinatorics are radically different when the cam is
there. In that regard my simulation is a little unique.

Besides choosing to model the cam, I noticed another variation on how some
other simulators assume the clock mechanics work.

There seems to broad consensus about how the clock mechanics work until you go
from 12:59 to 1:00. All the other simulators I've seen assume that the last
ball to drop between 12:59 and 1:00 comes back into the reservoir last. After
observing my own clock carefully and stepping through the YouTube video, I feel
confident that the last ball to drop between 12:59 and 1:00 actually cycles
back to the reservoir just ***before*** the balls in the hour rail. To see what
I mean, set the playback speed on [the
video]((https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7K6GIBWPQw)) to 0.25x, advance it to
the 4:00 mark, and press play. I found it fascinating that this one little
difference also had a massive effect on the simulation results.

The simulator allows you to concurrently run different scenarios from 27 (the
minimum number of balls required to run the clock) up to 1,000 balls, and you
can save your results to a csv file for later analysis. It uses multiprocessing
to concurrently cycle *n* clocks at a time, where *n* is the number of
available CPUs on your computer. In addition to utilizing multiprocessing, the
simulator takes advantage of a unique repeating pattern to further speed up
calculations.

At each 12-hr interval, all the balls in the clock are in the reservoir. If you
start with a fresh clock and brute-force cycle it for 720 minutes (12-hrs),
then you get what I call a permutation vector in the reservoir. You can now
treat each ball number in the reservoir as an index (position) for the movement
of the balls every 12-hrs.

For example: if cycling a fresh clock 12-hrs results in ball #10 ending up in
position #2, that means every 12-hrs the ball in position #10 will migrate to
position #2. Using two Python lists, we can now cycle the clock for 12-hrs each
"tick", rather then 1-minute for each "tick". The speed gains in clock cycling
are dramatic.

I also found that several clocks will cycle back to the initial condition in a
fractional number of days -- 18.5 days in the case of a clock with 38 balls.
This may have something to do with the way I've modeled the clock mechanics,
but I couldn't find another solution to the Ball Clock problem that cycled a
given clock on the 12-hr boundary; they all cycled for a whole number of days.

## Peer(less) Review

Writing this simulator gave me some great practice with Python programming
topics: argument parsing, classes, multiprocessing, inter-process
communication, queues and project packaging (pypi). While not required to use
the program, I also included detailed API documentation for those who are
interested.

It's not really practical to validate my assumptions using a physical clock --
in some cases it takes billions of simulated days to cycle back to the starting
position. I would love it if someone coded this up independently, using the
same clock mechanics I describe, and validated or invalidated the program's
results.
