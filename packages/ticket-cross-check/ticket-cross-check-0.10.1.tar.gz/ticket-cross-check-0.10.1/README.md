# Ticket Cross Checker

Take gitlab issues and find them in code and vice versa.
Create a mapping table to see what's covered, missing or wrong.

An example are the [Gitlab Pages](https://exb.gitlab.io/engineering/ticket-cross-check/) for this project.


## Usage

start the cross checker in your CI pipeline

```gitlab

pages:
  stage: test
  script:
    - pdm run discover ticket_cross_check spec
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - public
  rules:
    - if: $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH == "main"

```

### Add to existing gitlab pages

- caches existing `public` directories and creates a sub-dir `tcc`

```yaml
cache:
  paths:
    - public

discover_issues:
  image: python:latest
  stage: build
  script:
    - python -m pip install --upgrade pip
    - pip install ticket_cross_check
    - discover code doc spec test -o public/tcc
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - public
  rules:
    - if: $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH == "main"
```

### Avoid logging

- we use [loguru](https://loguru.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/logger.html), 
you can disable loguru auto init by setting `LOGURU_AUTOINIT` to `False` in your environment

## Development

### Requirements

* We use `pdm` for packaging (not pip, poetry or alinke) 
* `pdm install` shall be run before you do anything (esp. in PyCharm), after that you find a `.venv` in the project root

* `pdm add [-d] <package>` to add more deps (fount in [pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml))

### How to install pdm

- See [pdm homepage](https://pdm.fming.dev/latest/#recommended-installation-method)
- Usually you run `curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pdm-project/pdm/main/install-pdm.py | python3 -`

### Run gitlab-runner locally for single target

* download/install [the gitlab-runner](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/install/linux-manually.html) for your system
* install docker
* run `gitlab-runner exec docker <target>` `target` comes from [.gitlab-ci.yml](.gitlab-ci.yml)
* done :)
* btw caching only works with an S3 backend, see [docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/configuration/advanced-configuration.html#the-runnerscache-section)

### Testing with pytest

* we use [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.1.x/)


### Code style with flake8

* config is in [.flake8](.flake8)
* details can be found in the [flake8 docs](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/user/configuration.html)

### Local installation and experiements

* `pdm install` also installs the cli scripts, defined in [ticket_cross_check/__init__.py](ticket_cross_check/__init__.py) or [pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml)
* you can run `discover <dir> [<dir> [<dir>]]` to cross-check the given directories
