# SpecCAF: Python implementation of a Spectral Continuum Anisotropic Fabric evolution model 

A spectral fabric evolution model for ice based on the theory of mixtures of continuous diversity (Faria, 2006; Placidi, 2010) that has been shown to reproduce experimentally observed fabrics (Richards et al. 2021). The model incorporates the effects of rigid-body rotation, basal-slip deformation, migration and rotational recrystallization, and requires velocity gradient and temperature as inputs. 

## Installation

`pip install speccaf`

Currently, matrices are built for L=4,6,8,12 and 20. If you wish to run the model with a different L value to this, you must first use the script matrixbuild.py to save pre-allocated arrays, and move this file to the packages local data directory.
