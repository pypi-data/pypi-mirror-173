MMSA-Feature Extraction Toolkit extracts multimodal features for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis Datasets. It integrates several commonly used tools for visual, acoustic and text modality. The extracted features are compatible with the [MMSA](https://github.com/thuiar/MMSA) Framework and thus can be used directly. The tool can also extract features for single videos.

This work is included in the ACL-2022 DEMO paper: [M-SENA: An Integrated Platform for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis](). If you find our work useful, don't hesitate to cite our paper. Thank you!

### Features

- Extract fully customized features for single videos or datasets. 
- Integrate some most commonly used tools, including Librosa, OpenFace, Transformers, etc. 
- Support Active Speaker Detection in case multiple faces exists in a video. 
- Easy to use, provides Python APIs and commandline tools. 
- Extracted features are compatible with [MMSA](https://github.com/thuiar/MMSA), a unified training & testing framework for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis.

## 1. Installation

MMSA-Feature Extraction Toolkit is available from PyPI. Due to package size limitation on PyPi, large model files cannot be shipped with the package. Users need to run a post install command to download these files manually. If you can't access Google Drive, please refer to [this page](https://github.com/FlameSky-S/MMSA-FET/wiki/Dependency-Installation#2-post-installation-script) for manual download. 

```bash
# Install package from PyPI
$ pip install MMSA-FET
# Download models & libraries from Google Drive. Use --proxy if needed.
$ python -m MSA_FET install
```

> **Note:** A few system-wide dependancies need to be installed manually. See [Dependency Installation](https://github.com/FlameSky-S/MMSA-FET/wiki/Dependency-Installation) for more information.

## 2. Quick Start

MMSA-FET is fairly easy to use. You can either call API in python or use commandline interface. Below is a basic example using python APIs.

> **Note:** To extract features for datasets, the datasets need to be organized in a specific file structure, and a `label.csv` file is needed. See [Dataset and Structure](https://github.com/FlameSky-S/MMSA-FET/wiki/Dataset-and-Structure) for details. Raw video files and label files for MOSI, MOSEI and CH-SIMS can be downloaded from [BaiduYunDisk](https://pan.baidu.com/s/14dDwya98MK4fFI0qn-ujhw?pwd=gsxk) or [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1A2S4pqCHryGmiqnNSPLv7rEg63WvjCSk?usp=sharing).

```python
from MSA_FET import FeatureExtractionTool

# initialize with default librosa config which only extracts audio features
fet = FeatureExtractionTool("librosa")

# alternatively initialize with a custom config file
fet = FeatureExtractionTool("custom_config.json")

# extract features for single video
feature = fet.run_single("input.mp4")
print(feature)

# extract for dataset & save features to file
feature = fet.run_dataset(dataset_dir="~/MOSI", out_file="output/feature.pkl")
```

The `custom_config.json` is the path to a custom config file, the format of which is introduced below.

For detailed usage, please read [APIs](https://github.com/FlameSky-S/MMSA-FET/wiki/APIs) and [Command Line Arguments](https://github.com/FlameSky-S/MMSA-FET/wiki/Command-Line-Arguments).

## 3. Config File

MMSA-FET comes with a few example configs which can be used like below.

```python
# Each supported tool has an example config
fet = FeatureExtractionTool(config="librosa")
fet = FeatureExtractionTool(config="opensmile")
fet = FeatureExtractionTool(config="wav2vec")
fet = FeatureExtractionTool(config="openface")
fet = FeatureExtractionTool(config="mediapipe")
fet = FeatureExtractionTool(config="bert")
fet = FeatureExtractionTool(config="roberta")
```

For customized features, you can: 

1. Edit the default configs and pass a dictionary to the config parameter like the example below:

```python
from MSA_FET import FeatureExtractionTool, get_default_config

# here we only extract audio and video features
config_a = get_default_config('opensmile')
config_v = get_default_config('openface')

# modify default config
config_a['audio']['args']['feature_level'] = 'LowLevelDescriptors'

# combine audio and video configs
config = {**config_a, **config_v}

# initialize
fet = FeatureExtractionTool(config=config)
```

2. Provide a config json file. The below example extracts features of all three modalities. To extract unimodal features, just remove unnecessary sections from the file.

```json
{
  "audio": {
    "tool": "librosa",
    "sample_rate": null,
    "args": {
      "mfcc": {
        "n_mfcc": 20,
        "htk": true
      },
      "rms": {},
      "zero_crossing_rate": {},
      "spectral_rolloff": {},
      "spectral_centroid": {}
    }
  },
  "video": {
    "tool": "openface",
    "fps": 25,
    "average_over": 3,
    "args": {
      "hogalign": false,
      "simalign": false,
      "nobadaligned": false,
      "landmark_2D": true,
      "landmark_3D": false,
      "pdmparams": false,
      "head_pose": true,
      "action_units": true,
      "gaze": true,
      "tracked": false
    }
  },
  "text": {
    "model": "bert",
    "device": "cpu",
    "pretrained": "models/bert_base_uncased",
    "args": {}
  }
}
```
