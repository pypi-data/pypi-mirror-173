    This function is intended to be used after editing a mesh in QGIS
    or other standalone software that may not preserve 2DM-specific
    features such as materials or node strings.

    This requries node IDs to remain unchanged.

    Rules:

    - The nodes from `edited` are used without modification.
    - The elements from `edited` are used, but will use the material
      from the corresponding element in `source` if it exists.
    - The node strings from `source` are used, any missing nodes are
      silently ignored, potentially resulting in a shorter node string.

       This utility is considered a pre-release and should not be
       relied on in larger workflows as changes are likely in upcoming
       versions.

    For every element in `source`, the element containing it is looked
    up in `other`. If it exists, the MATIDs are passed to the `query`
    function, which decides how the material indices are combined into
    a single materials list. The result is then written to the output
    mesh's element.

    The default behaviour is to append the MATIDs from `other` to the
    MATIDs from `source`. Below are several examples of other common
    query functions:

    .. code-block:: python

       def append_first(a, b):

       def replace_matid(a, b):
           # Replace the first MATID in `source` with the one from
           # `other`. This avoids interpolation after changing MATIDs.
           return b[:1] + a[1:]

    The node and element IDs of the resulting mesh are the same as the
    `source` mesh.
