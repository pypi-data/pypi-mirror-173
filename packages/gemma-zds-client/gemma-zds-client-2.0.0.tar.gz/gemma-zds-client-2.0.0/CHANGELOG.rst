2.0.0 (2022-10-28)
------------------

Major release with breaking changes ðŸ’¥

This release is shaped by how the library/client is typically used, so we have removed
features and public API that sees no real-world usage. The result is a cleaner, more
obvious API that we can build new features on top of.

**Breaking changes**

* Dropped support for Python 3.6
* Dropped support for PyJWT versions older than 2.0.0
* Removed client initialization from a registry with alias -> config mappings
* Removed loading client configuration from YAML
* Removed loading client configuration from dictionary/keyword arguments
* Removed client initialization from a resource (detail) URL
* Removed logging every request/response in memory (instead, use requests' hooks)
* Replaced base URL + base path combination with ``api_root`` attribute
* ``Client.pre_request`` no longer takes unpacked keywoard arguments, instead it accepts
  a ``kwargs`` keyword argument that is expected to be mutated. ``kwargs`` contains the
  keyword arguments that will be passed down into the requests call.
* The ``query_params`` kwarg is removed from ``Client.list``

Private API changes:

* The internal ``zds_client.config`` module was removed
* The internal ``zds_client.log`` module was removed
* The internal ``zds_client.registry`` module was removed

**New features**

* Added support for Python 3.10
* Expose type hints
* Added first-class support for requests' hook/event registration
* Setting the (resolved) client schema is now public API

**Refactoring**

* Client class is now a ``dataclasses.dataclass``
* Applied more type-hinting
* Updated and extended documentation
* Maintainership is transferred to Maykin Media

**Future plans**

This client performs OpenAPI schema processing to extract the URLs/paths and
default/required headers without having to provide those explicitly. In the future,
we will probably adopt https://pypi.org/project/openapi3-parser/ so we can fully support
the OpenAPI 3.0 features. This may lead to more public API deprecations.

We're working on improving the connection pooling using ``requests.Session``, especially
in contexts where threading is used. requests maintainers recommend using one session
per thread, so we'll be following that advice.

1.0.1 (2021-07-23)
------------------

Bugfix dealing with optional ``required`` key for header parameters.

1.0.0 (2021-03-16)
------------------

Stable release - according to semantic versioning new minor releases will be backwards
compatible and breaking changes will bump the major version number. Note that this
applies to the *public* API.

The public API is frozen in this release. Anything documented in ``docs`` (including
the reference) is considered public API, anything else is considered private API.

**Breaking changes**

A number of deprecations have been removed:

* ``zds_client.ClientAuth`` - any extra kwargs are now included in the JWT payload
  rather than being nested in a ``zds`` namespace object.

  Before:

  .. code-block:: python

      auth = ClientAuth("client-id", "secret", foo="bar")

  would lead to the payload:

  .. code-block:: json

      {
        "iss": "client-id",
        "iat": "1615891267",
        "client_id": "client-id",
        "user_id": "",
        "user_representation": "",
        "zds": {
            "foo": "bar",
        }
      }

  Now the resulting payload is:

  .. code-block:: json

      {
        "iss": "client-id",
        "iat": "1615891267",
        "client_id": "client-id",
        "user_id": "",
        "user_representation": "",
        "foo": "bar"
      }

* The custom ``client_identifier`` JWT header is removed. This was only kept for
  interaction with alpha releases of the ZGW standard. The ``client_id`` claim in the
  payload is the canonical source of this information.

* ``zds_client.tests`` package is removed, which included the ``MockClient``. Replace
  these calls with requests-mock_ or responses_ instead.

* Removed ``zds_client.nlx`` - use `zgw-consumers`_ instead.

0.15.0 (2021-03-15)
-------------------

Preparations towards a 1.0 release

**Breaking changes**

``zds_client.schema.Schema`` was removed. The initial reason to add it was to serve as
a tool for NLX url rewriting middleware, which became obsolete with `zgw-consumers`_'
built-in support. If you need to parse OpenAPI 3.0 schema's, openapi-parser_ looks
viable.

.. _zgw-consumers: https://pypi.org/project/zgw-consumers/
.. _openapi-parser: https://pypi.org/project/openapi-parser/

**Deprecations**

* ``zds_client.auth.ClientAuth.claims`` - claims namespaced under ``zds`` in the JWT
  payload are deprecated and scheduled for removal in 1.0.

  These claims became obsolete after the shift to store the application authorizations
  in the Autorisaties API.

  1.0 will support extra claims, but they will be added to the token payload without
  the ``zds`` namespace.

* ``zds_client.Client.list``: ``query_params`` arg is deprecated in favour of
  ``params``. This matches the underlying ``requests`` interface.

* ``zds_client.tests.mocks`` is deprecated. The mock client shim is overly complex and
  requires Django. Use requests-mock_ or responses_ instead to mock the underlying
  ``requests`` calls.

* ``zds_client.nlx`` module is deprecated. `zgw-consumers`_ is a better solution for
  Django-based projects. This module was Django-only already because of the dependency
  ``nlx-url-rewriter``.

.. _requests-mock: https://pypi.org/project/requests-mock/
.. _responses: https://pypi.org/project/responses/

**New stuff**

* Added public API documentation, hosted on readthedocs.io
* Added docs build to CI workflow
