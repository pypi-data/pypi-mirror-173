Welcome to calculator_val project!

This is a simple calculator that performs a few basic operations.
The operations available are 'sum', 'sub', 'mult', 'div','nroot', 'delete'.

sum : adds up a number to the value stored in memory.

sub: subtracts the argument from the value in memory.

mult: multiplies the memory by the argument provided

div: divides the memory by the input given

nroot: returns the n_th root of the value stored in memory

delete: resets the calculator by assigning 0 to the memory


don't worry too much about this description, all the information you need will be provided the prompt line while using the package. To get started just run the __init__.py file. A nice menu GUI will guide you through the use of the calculator and ask you directly which operations you want to perform and so on.
If you are an advanced user you can also install the calculator module form pip under the name calculator_val. This code is protected by MIT Licence.

Enjoy!
