Gymnasium is an open source Python library for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms by providing a standard API to communicate between learning algorithms and environments, as well as a standard set of environments compliant with that API. This is a fork of OpenAI's [Gym](https://github.com/openai/gym) library by the maintainers (OpenAI handed over maintenance a few years ago to an outside team), and is where future maintenance will occur going forward

The documentation website is at [gymnasium.farama.org](https://gymnasium.farama.org), and we have a public discord server (which we also use to coordinate development work) that you can join here: https://discord.gg/bnJ6kubTg6


## Environments

Gymnasium includes the following families of environments along with a wide variety of third-party environments
* [Classic Control](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/classic_control/) - These are classic reinforcement learning based on real-world problems and physics.
* [Box2D](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/box2d/) - These environments all involve toy games based around physics control, using box2d based physics and PyGame-based rendering
* [Toy Text](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/toy_text/) - These environments are designed to be extremely simple, with small discrete state and action spaces, and hence easy to learn. As a result, they are suitable for debugging implementations of reinforcement learning algorithms.
* [MuJoCo](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/mujoco/) - A physics engine based environments with multi-joint control which are more complex than the Box2D environments.
* [Atari](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/atari/) - A set of 57 Atari 2600 environments simulated through Stella and the Arcade Learning Environment that have a high range of complexity for agents to learn.
* [Third-party](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/third_party_environments/) - A number of environments have been created that are compatible with the Gymnasium API. Be aware of the version that the software was created for and use the `apply_env_compatibility` in `gymnasium.make` if necessary.
