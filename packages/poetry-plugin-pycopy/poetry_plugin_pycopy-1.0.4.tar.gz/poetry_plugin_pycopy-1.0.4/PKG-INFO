This plugin adds command `pycopy` to Poetry which will copy information from `pyproject.toml` to `source` directory. 

The goal is to have `pyproject.toml` as a single source of truth for app version, name, description etc. and to have these values available during a program runtime.

## Use case
FastAPI app in which you want to show application name or version in API docs.


## Installation

From Pypi:
```
$ poetry self add poetry-plugin-pycopy
```

## Usage

```
$ poetry pycopy
```

## Plugin configuration in `pyproject.toml`

```
[tool.poetry-plugin-pycopy]
keys = ["name", "version", "description"]
dest_dir = "<some_package_name>"
dest_file = "__init__.py"
```
- `keys` list tells which fields should by copied from `[tool.poetry]`
- `dest_dir` is package/module root
- `dest_file` is the name of an output file

Plugin also runs with `$poetry version` command automatically. So when you use version bump, e.g.: `$poetry version patch` the plugin will copy the new version value into the output file.

## Output file example
The `dest_file` is set to `__init__.py`. Thus the plugin will create or replace that file with current values for a given `keys`. For example:

```
__name = "poetry-plugin-pycopy"
__version = "1.0.0"
__description = "Copy fields from pyproject.toml to source directory"

```
