Known issues
===============

The acquisition frame rate is lower than what is obtained with the constructor software. On the camera used for testing, the frame rate is limited to a few FPS in full frame. This is because so far, images are only captured in 'snap' mode. A 'stream' mode looks available, and could be implemented in the future.
