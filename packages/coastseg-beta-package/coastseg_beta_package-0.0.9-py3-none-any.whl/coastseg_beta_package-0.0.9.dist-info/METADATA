## Installation Instructions

### Create an environment with Anaconda

In order to use Coastseg you need to install Python packages in an environment. We recommend you use [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) to install the python packages in an environment for Coastseg.

After you install Anaconda on your PC, open the Anaconda prompt or Terminal in in Mac and Linux and use the `cd` command (change directory) to go the folder where you have downloaded the Coastseg repository.

Create a new environment named `coastseg` with all the required packages by entering these commands:

### Install Coastseg

```
conda create -n coastseg python=3.8
conda activate coastseg

## coastsat dependencies
conda install -c conda-forge earthengine-api astropy utm -y
conda install gdal geopandas scikit-image notebook pyqt -y
conda install -c conda-forge â€œnumpy>=1.16.5, <=1.23.0" -y

## additional coastseg dependencies
conda install ipython cartopy  tqdm  -y
conda install -c conda-forge simplekml leafmap pydensecrf h5py -y
pip install area doodleverse_utils
conda install -c conda-forge tensorflow-gpu
pip install coastsat_package
```

### Activate Coastseg Environment

All the required packages have now been installed in an environment called coastseg. Always make sure that the environment is activated with:

`conda activate coastseg`
To confirm that you have successfully activated coastseg, your terminal command line prompt should now start with (coastseg).

### Installation Errors

Use the command `conda clean --all` to clean old packages from your anaconda base environment. Ensure you are not in your coastseg environment or any other environment by running `conda deactivate`, to deactivate any environment you're in before running `conda clean --all`. It is recommended that you have Anaconda prompt (terminal for Mac and Linux) open as an administrator before you attempt to install `coastseg` again.

#### Conda Clean Steps

```
conda deactivate
conda clean --all
```

## Installation

We advise creating a new conda environment to run the program.

1. Clone the repo:

```
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/dbuscombe-usgs/CoastSeg.git
```

(`--depth 1` means "give me only the present code, not the whole history of git commits" - this saves disk space, and time)

2. Create a conda environment called `coastseg`

```
conda env create --file install/coastseg.yml
conda activate coastseg
```
