        Visualizing financial relations and evolutions.
        
        Stock picking is hard, and has a [terrible track record](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/18/stock-picking-has-a-terrible-track-record-and-its-getting-worse.html).
        
        If you're going to do it, two things would go a long way in mitigating the 
        mess of information amongst the mass of noise: 
        - building intuition based on multi-faceted facts
        - being able to test ideas at the speed of thought
        
        These are just tools to help out in that direction.
