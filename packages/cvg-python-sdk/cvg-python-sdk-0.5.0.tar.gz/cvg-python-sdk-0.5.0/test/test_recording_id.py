    VIER Cognitive Voice Assist API

    With the CVG Assist API you can use live transcriptions of customers to provide in-call agent assistance.  CVG Assist API requires some integration with contact center software to link ACD phone number, dialogID und agentID. The call has to be bridged to the contact center head number of e.g. a hotline plus an extension. The contact center then has to invoke `/assist/accept` with the phone number.  Integration with VIER Engage is available. Ask us if you are interested in integrating other contact center software.  CVG Assist API is part of the VIER Cognitive Voice Gateway.  For more details, see [our documentation](/docs/Essential-Use-Cases.html#agent-assistance).  # noqa: E501
