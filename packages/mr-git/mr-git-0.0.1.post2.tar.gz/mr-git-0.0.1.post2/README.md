# MR Git

**MR Git** stands for "Multi-Repositories Git". (But you can go ahead
and call it *Mister Git*.)

In large projects, the trend is to have a mono-repo because it simplifies the git management.

**MR Git** is here to change this, and make the git management of
products involving multiple repos easy, when these repo share similar
characteristics (like: users, and branches to some degree).
